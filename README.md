- 👋 Hi, I’m Mariana - but for Heaven's sake, just call me Mari.
- 👀 I’m interested in EVERYTHING. But I'm trying to stick to learning new languages - programming and speaking-wise.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python and HTML.
- 💞️ I’m collaborating on the Automaladies community. But feel free to invite me to collabs, if you'd like to.
- 📫 How to reach me: just send me an e-mail! mariana.pm96@gmail.com
